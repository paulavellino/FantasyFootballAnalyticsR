## Projection Graphs Standard Leagues  {.tabset .tabset-pills}
### RB
#### Standard Scoring League Running Backs

From the graph below notice that:
  
- Melvin Gordon, Latavius Murray, Jay Ajayi, Javorius Allen and Josh Ferguson are the five players
 with the <b>largest upside</b> (as measured from their (pseudo)medians). For these players,
 some projections are placing much higher valuations than others. 
 If you are projected to lose this week by quite a few points and
 are looking for a risky play that may tip the balance in your favor,
 these are players to consider.
- Terrance West, Theo Riddick, Shaun Draughn, Alfred Morris and Jacquizz Rodgers are the players with the 
    <b> smallest downside</b>, which suggests that while their median projection might
    not be great, there is less uncertainty concerning how poorly they may perform.  So,
    if you are likely to win by a lot and want to reduce your downside risk, these
    players may deserve extra attention.
- On the other hand, DeMarco Murray, Melvin Gordon, Arian Foster, Cameron Artis-Payne and Jonathan Stewart are the five players with the <b>largest downside</b> this week.  If you are 
    planning on starting them, it may be prudent to investigate why some projections have 
    such low expectations for these players.

 are looking for a risky play that may tip the balance in your favor,
 these are players to consider.
- Mike Evans, Jarvis Landry, Torrey Smith, Cole Beasley and Seth Roberts are the players with the 
    <b> smallest downside</b>, which suggests that while their median projection might
    not be great, there is less uncertainty concerning how poorly they may perform.  So,
    if you are likely to win by a lot and want to reduce your downside risk, these
    players may deserve extra attention.
- On the other hand, Antonio Brown, Julio Jones, Larry Fitzgerald, Dez Bryant and Ted Ginn are the five players with the <b>largest downside</b> this week.  If you are

#### Standard Scoring League Quarterback
  
From the graph below notice that:

 with the <b>largest upside</b> (as measured from their (pseudo)medians). For these players,
 some projections are placing much higher valuations than others.

 are looking for a risky play that may tip the balance in your favor,
 these are players to consider.
- Andrew Luck, Andy Dalton, Ryan Tannehill, Dak Prescott and Case Keenum are the players with the 
    <b> smallest downside</b>, which suggests that while their median projection might
    not be great, there is less uncertainty concerning how poorly they may perform.  So,
    if you are likely to win by a lot and want to reduce your downside risk, these
    players may deserve extra attention.
- On the other hand, Aaron Rodgers, Carson Palmer, Marcus Mariota, Brian Hoyer and Paxton Lynch are the five players with the <b>largest downside</b> this week.  If you are 
    planning on starting them, it may be prudent to investigate why some projections have

 these are players to consider.
- Dwayne Allen, Charles Clay, Lance Kendricks, Will Tye and Ryan Griffin are the players with the

- Hunter Henry, Antonio Gates, Richard Rodgers, Dion Sims and Trey Burton are the five players
 with the <b>largest upside</b> (as measured from their (pseudo)medians). For these players,
 some projections are placing much higher valuations than others. 
 If you are projected to lose this week by quite a few points and
 are looking for a risky play that may tip the balance in your favor,
 these are players to consider.
- Kyle Rudolph, Jason Witten, Ryan Griffin, Darren Fells and Crockett Gillmore are the players with the 
    <b> smallest downside</b>, which suggests that while their median projection might
    not be great, there is less uncertainty concerning how poorly they may perform.  So,
    if you are likely to win by a lot and want to reduce your downside risk, these
    players may deserve extra attention.
- On the other hand, Hunter Henry, Tyler Eifert, Antonio Gates, Austin Seferian-Jenkins and Trey Burton are the five players with the <b>largest downside</b> this week.  If you are 
    planning on starting them, it may be prudent to investigate why some projections have
